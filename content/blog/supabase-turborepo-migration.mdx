This was one of the largest infrastructure changes I led at Supabase—migrating our entire UI library and moving Studio into a consolidated turborepo structure.

## The Problem

Supabase had grown organically with:

- A standalone UI library published to npm
- Studio (the dashboard) as a separate Next.js application  
- Marketing site with its own copy of components
- No shared build pipeline

This meant changes to shared components required publishing to npm, waiting for the package to be available, then updating each application independently. A simple button color change could take hours to propagate.

## The Migration

The migration touched **1,130 files** with over **32,000 lines added** and **14,000 removed**. Key changes included:

- Moving the UI library into `packages/ui` within the monorepo
- Configuring Turborepo for intelligent caching and parallel builds
- Setting up shared Tailwind and TypeScript configurations
- Creating internal package references instead of npm dependencies

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

## The Result

After the migration:

- **10x faster local development** with shared caching
- **Instant component updates** across all applications
- **Simplified CI/CD** with Turborepo's remote caching
- **Better DX** for contributors working across packages

This laid the groundwork for the design system site and all subsequent UI improvements.
