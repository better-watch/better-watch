Users need visibility into how their database is performing. I built the reports system to surface key metrics and help identify issues.

## Reports Overview

The reports section provides:

- **Database Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage over time
- **Query Performance**: Slow queries, most frequent queries
- **API Usage**: Request counts, response times
- **Storage Stats**: Bucket usage, file counts

## Reports Dropdown Fix

Early on, the reports dropdown had display issues:

```tsx title="Reports dropdown fix"
// Fixed dropdown not displaying correctly
// Updated to latest @supabase/ui
<Dropdown overlay={reportsMenu}>
  <Button type="text">
    Reports <ChevronDown />
  </Button>
</Dropdown>
```

## Query Performance Report

Added a dedicated report for query performance using the same "hooks factory" pattern as other reports:

```typescript title="Query performance report hook"
export function useQueryPerformanceReport(projectRef: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['query-performance', projectRef],
    queryFn: () => getQueryStats(projectRef),
  })
}
```

### Features

- Most time-consuming queries
- Most frequently run queries  
- Queries with potential for optimization
- Index suggestions

## Reports Architecture

Reports follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Data fetching**: Custom hooks using react-query
2. **Visualization**: Charts with Recharts
3. **Date range**: Shared date picker component
4. **Export**: CSV/JSON download options

## Unlocking Reports

Reports were initially locked for certain tiers. We unlocked them to give all users visibility:

```typescript title="Unlocking reports"
// Previously: reports locked for free tier
// Now: available for all projects
const canViewReports = true // Removed tier check
```

## Integration with Logs

Reports now connect with the logs system:

- Click a slow query to see related logs
- Filter logs by the time range from reports
- Jump from error spikes to log details

## Result

The reports system helps users understand their database performance and identify optimization opportunities before they become problems.
