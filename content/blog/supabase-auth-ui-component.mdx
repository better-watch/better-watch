<PRTable slug="supabase-auth-ui-component" />
Authentication is the first thing most apps need. I built the original `<Auth />` component for `@supabase/ui`—a drop-in solution for any React application.

## The Vision

Instead of building auth UI from scratch every time, developers should have:

```tsx title="One-line authentication"
<Auth supabaseClient={supabase} />
```

That's it. Full authentication flow, styled and functional.

## Supported Auth Methods

The component supports all Supabase auth methods:

### Email/Password

```tsx title="Email authentication"
<Auth
  supabaseClient={supabase}
  providers={[]}
  view="sign_in"
/>
```

### Magic Links

Passwordless email authentication:

```tsx title="Magic link flow"
<Auth
  supabaseClient={supabase}
  magicLink
/>
```

### OAuth Providers

Social authentication with multiple providers:

```tsx title="OAuth providers"
<Auth
  supabaseClient={supabase}
  providers={['google', 'github', 'twitter', 'discord']}
/>
```

### Phone/SMS

Phone number authentication with OTP:

```tsx title="Phone auth"
<Auth
  supabaseClient={supabase}
  view="phone_sign_in"
/>
```

## MFA Support

In 2022, I added MFA sign-up widget support:

- TOTP enrollment flow
- QR code generation
- Backup codes display
- Factor management

## Customization

### Theme Support

Full theming via CSS variables:

```tsx title="Custom theming"
<Auth
  supabaseClient={supabase}
  theme="dark"
  appearance={{
    variables: {
      default: {
        colors: {
          brand: '#3ECF8E',
          brandAccent: '#2B9E6A',
        },
      },
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Redirect Handling

Custom redirect after authentication:

```tsx title="Redirect configuration"
<Auth
  supabaseClient={supabase}
  redirectTo="https://app.example.com/dashboard"
/>
```

## Auth UI Package

The component eventually moved to `@supabase/auth-ui-react`:

- Separate package for flexibility
- Stitches for styling (later migrated)
- Theme exports for customization
- Type-safe props

## Technical Details

### State Management

The component handles complex auth state:

- Loading states during auth operations
- Error display with clear messaging
- View transitions (sign in → sign up → forgot password)
- Success states and redirects

### Accessibility

Authentication must be accessible:

- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management between views
- Error messaging for assistive tech

### Auto-focus

I added auto-focus for better UX:

```tsx title="Auto-focus on load"
<Input
  autoFocus={view === 'sign_in'}
  type="email"
  placeholder="Your email"
/>
```

## Impact

The Auth component:

1. Saves hours of development time per project
2. Ensures consistent, tested auth flows
3. Handles edge cases developers might miss
4. Stays updated with Supabase Auth features

Authentication shouldn't require reinventing the wheel.
