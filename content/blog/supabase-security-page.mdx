Enterprise customers need to trust their database provider. I built the security and compliance pages that communicate Supabase's security posture.

## Security Landing Page

The security landing page addresses key concerns:

- **Infrastructure security**: How data is protected
- **Data encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Access controls**: Authentication and authorization
- **Compliance certifications**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA
- **Incident response**: How issues are handled

## Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

I added the DPA page for GDPR compliance:

```markdown title="DPA contents"
- Data processing terms
- Sub-processor list
- Data location information
- Security measures description
- Breach notification procedures
```

This is essential for European customers and any company handling personal data.

## SOC2 Compliance

The security page prominently features SOC2 certification:

- Type II certification badge
- Report request process
- Scope of certification
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## Page Structure

The security page follows a trust-building structure:

1. **Overview**: High-level security summary
2. **Infrastructure**: Technical security details
3. **Certifications**: Compliance badges
4. **Policies**: Links to detailed documentation
5. **Contact**: Security team contact info

## Technical Implementation

### Visual Design

The security page uses a distinct visual style:

- Dark, professional aesthetic
- Trust indicators and badges
- Clear hierarchy of information
- Mobile-responsive layout

### Content Management

Security content updates frequently:

- New certifications added
- Sub-processor list maintained
- Policy documents linked
- Contact information current

## Enterprise Trust

For enterprise sales, security documentation is crucial:

- Procurement teams review security pages
- Legal teams need DPAs
- Security teams need technical details
- Compliance teams need certifications

## Impact

The security pages:

1. Reduce security questionnaire burden
2. Accelerate enterprise sales cycles
3. Build trust with privacy-conscious users
4. Demonstrate commitment to security

Security isn't just technical—it's communication.
