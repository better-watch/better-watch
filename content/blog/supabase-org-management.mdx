<PRTable slug="supabase-org-management" />
Supabase is a team tool. I built key parts of the organization and team management system.

## Organization Selection

When creating a project, users can select which organization owns it:

```tsx title="Org selector on project creation"
<Select
  value={selectedOrg}
  onChange={setSelectedOrg}
  options={userOrganizations}
  label="Organization"
/>
```

This was a highly requested feature for users managing multiple organizations.

## Organization Layout

In 2025, I built the new organization layout:

- Unified navigation for org-level settings
- Project listing within organizations
- Member management
- Billing and subscription controls

## Member Management

### Adding Members

Invite flow with email validation:

```typescript title="Email validation"
const validateEmail = (email: string) => {
  return Yup.string().email().isValidSync(email)
}
```

### Removing Members

I fixed the owner leave team action and added proper confirmation modals:

- Prevent accidental removals
- Transfer ownership requirements
- Clear messaging about consequences

### Member Transfers

When transferring projects between organizations:

- Stripe subscription updates
- Member permission resets
- Proper validation

## Organization Limits

API enforcement of organization limits:

```typescript title="Org limit check"
if (userOrgs.length >= orgLimit) {
  throw new Error('Organization limit reached')
}
```

## Settings Navigation

I added proper navigation with tabs:

```tsx title="Settings navigation"
<Tabs>
  <Tab id="general">General</Tab>
  <Tab id="members">Members</Tab>
  <Tab id="billing">Billing</Tab>
  <Tab id="integrations">Integrations</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

## Integrations

Organization-level integrations:

- GitHub connection
- Vercel integration
- Third-party OAuth apps

## Impact

Organization management enables:

1. Team collaboration on projects
2. Clear permission boundaries
3. Consolidated billing
4. Enterprise workflows

Teams need structure to work effectively.
