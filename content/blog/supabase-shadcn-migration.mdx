<PRTable slug="supabase-shadcn-migration" />
When Shadcn UI emerged as a new approach to component libraries—components you own rather than install—it aligned perfectly with our design system philosophy. I led the integration effort that touched 127 files across the codebase.

## Why Shadcn?

Traditional component libraries give you a black box. You install a package, use their components, and hope their styling choices align with your brand. When they don't, you're fighting against the library.

Shadcn flipped this model. Instead of installing components, you copy them into your codebase. You own the code. You can modify anything.

For Supabase, this meant:

- **Full control** over component styling and behavior
- **No version conflicts** with peer dependencies
- **Better TypeScript support** since we control the types
- **Easier customization** for our specific needs

## The Integration

The migration wasn't a simple find-and-replace. We had to:

1. Audit existing components for parity with Shadcn equivalents
2. Migrate styling from our custom approach to the Shadcn pattern
3. Update all consumers across Studio and other applications
4. Ensure our theming system worked with the new components

```tsx title="Button migration example"
// Before: Custom implementation
<Button type="primary" size="medium">Click me</Button>

// After: Shadcn-based with our customizations  
<Button variant="default" size="md">Click me</Button>
```

## Key Components Migrated

- Button (with all variants and sizes)
- Dialog and AlertDialog
- DropdownMenu and ContextMenu
- Select and Combobox
- Input, Textarea, and form controls
- Tabs and navigation components

## Result

The Shadcn integration modernized our component architecture while maintaining full compatibility with our existing theming system. New components are now faster to build because we have a consistent, well-documented pattern to follow.
