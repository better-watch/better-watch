Dark mode is table stakes for developer tools. But not all dark modes are created equal. Some developers prefer a softer dark (grays instead of blacks), while others want true black backgrounds for OLED displays and maximum contrast.

I built "Deep Dark" as an additional theme option for Supabase Studio.

## Why Deep Dark?

Standard dark themes typically use dark grays (`#1a1a1a`, `#2d2d2d`) for backgrounds. This is easier on the eyes for extended use and provides more room for elevation through subtle lightening.

But some users specifically requested:

- **True black backgrounds** for OLED power savings
- **Higher contrast** for better readability
- **Reduced visual noise** with fewer gray variations

## The Implementation

Deep Dark required careful consideration of our token system. We couldn't just make everything darker—we needed to maintain:

- Sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility
- Visual hierarchy through elevation
- Clear distinction between interactive elements

```css title="Deep dark tokens"
[data-theme="deep-dark"] {
  --background-default: 0 0% 0%;
  --background-surface: 0 0% 4%;
  --background-overlay: 0 0% 8%;
  --foreground-default: 0 0% 100%;
  --border-default: 0 0% 15%;
}
```

The key insight was using pure black (`#000`) for the base background, then using subtle, desaturated grays for surface elevation. Borders become more important in this scheme since shadow-based elevation doesn't work as well on true black.

## Technical Details

The implementation touched 71 files across the codebase:

- Added new token definitions for deep-dark
- Updated the theme provider to support the third theme
- Added UI for theme selection (light, dark, deep-dark, system)
- Fixed components that assumed only two themes existed

## Result

Deep Dark is now available as a theme option in Supabase Studio. It's particularly popular with developers who:

- Use OLED monitors
- Work in very dark environments
- Simply prefer maximum contrast

The theming system's architecture made adding this third theme relatively straightforward—a testament to building flexible foundations.
