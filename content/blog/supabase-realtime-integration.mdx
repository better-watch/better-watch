Supabase Realtime enables live data synchronization. I built dashboard integrations for monitoring and debugging realtime connections.

## Realtime Landing Page

I built the Realtime product landing page:

- Feature explanations
- Use case examples
- Interactive demos
- Getting started guides

## Realtime Inspector

The inspector helps debug realtime connections:

### Connection Status

Visual indicators for connection state:

- Connected (green)
- Connecting (yellow)
- Disconnected (red)
- Error states with details

### Icon Colors

I updated inspector icon colors for better visibility:

```tsx title="Status icon colors"
const statusColors = {
  connected: 'text-green-500',
  connecting: 'text-yellow-500',
  disconnected: 'text-red-500',
}
```

## Channel Monitoring

Monitor active channels:

- Channel name and topic
- Subscriber count
- Message throughput
- Presence data

## Broadcast Messages

View broadcast messages in real-time:

- Message payloads
- Timestamps
- Sender information
- Message type indicators

## Presence Tracking

Track presence state:

- Active users in channels
- Join/leave events
- User metadata
- State synchronization

## Error Debugging

When connections fail:

- Error messages displayed clearly
- Retry mechanisms
- Rate limit indicators
- Configuration suggestions

## Integration with Logs

Realtime logs feed into unified logs:

- WebSocket connection events
- Message delivery tracking
- Error logging
- Performance metrics

## Impact

Realtime dashboard tools help developers:

1. Debug connection issues quickly
2. Monitor channel activity
3. Understand message flow
4. Optimize realtime usage

Observability is essential for real-time systems.
