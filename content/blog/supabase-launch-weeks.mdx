Supabase Launch Weeks are major events. I built the web experiences that make them memorable—landing pages, ticket systems, and daily reveal mechanics.

## Launch Week Format

Each Launch Week follows a pattern:

- **Monday-Friday**: Daily announcements
- **Landing page**: Central hub with countdown
- **Ticket system**: User-generated tickets for engagement
- **Daily reveals**: Content unlocking at specific times

## Launch Week 5 (2022)

For LW5, I built:

- Animated landing page with day-by-day reveals
- Video integration with proper aspect ratios
- Mobile-responsive countdown timers
- Social sharing integration

```tsx title="Day reveal component"
<LaunchDay
  day={5}
  title="One More Thing"
  video="/lw5-day5.mp4"
  blogUrl="/blog/launch-week-5-one-more-thing"
  isRevealed={currentDay >= 5}
/>
```

## Launch Week 7 (2023)

LW7 introduced more polish:

- Custom favicons and logos
- "One More Thing" thumbnail updates
- Announcement bar integration
- Enhanced SEO with video meta tags

## Launch Week X (2023)

For LWX, the experience evolved:

- Database design playground integration
- Server actions for real-time updates
- Caption fixes for accessibility
- Branching documentation updates

## The Ticket System

Users could generate personalized tickets:

```typescript title="Ticket generation"
interface Ticket {
  username: string
  ticketNumber: number
  generatedAt: Date
  shareableUrl: string
}
```

This drove social engagement as users shared their unique ticket numbers.

## Technical Challenges

### Timezone Handling

Reveals need to happen at the right time globally:

```typescript title="Countdown logic"
function getRevealTime(day: number) {
  // All reveals at 9am PT
  return new Date(`2023-04-${10 + day}T09:00:00-07:00`)
}
```

### Performance

Landing pages get massive traffic. Optimizations:

- Static generation where possible
- Image optimization
- Lazy loading for videos
- CDN-first asset delivery

### Accessibility

Launch weeks reach diverse audiences:

- Video captions for all content
- Keyboard navigation for day selectors
- Screen reader announcements for reveals
- Reduced motion alternatives

## Impact

Launch Week landing pages see millions of visits. They:

1. Build anticipation throughout the week
2. Drive social sharing and engagement
3. Showcase Supabase's personality
4. Create memorable brand moments

Launch Week is as much about the experience as the announcements.
