<PRTable slug="supabase-unified-logs" />
Debugging distributed systems requires good logs. When Supabase users have issues, they need to see what's happening across their database, auth, storage, and edge functions. I built the unified logs system to bring all of this together.

## The Challenge

Supabase runs multiple services, each with their own log formats:

- **PostgreSQL** logs for database queries
- **Auth** logs for authentication events
- **Storage** logs for file operations  
- **Edge Functions** logs for serverless execution
- **Realtime** logs for websocket connections

Previously, each had a separate interface. Developers had to context-switch between pages to debug a single user flow that touched multiple services.

## The Solution

The unified logs interface provides:

- **Single view** for all log types
- **Dynamic columns** that adapt to the log schema
- **Live filtering** with type-ahead suggestions
- **Inspection panel** for detailed log exploration
- **Time range selection** with relative and absolute options

## Technical Implementation

### Dynamic Columns

Different log types have different fields. Rather than hardcoding columns, the table dynamically generates them based on the data:

```typescript title="Dynamic column generation"
function generateColumns(logs: Log[]) {
  const allKeys = new Set<string>()
  logs.forEach(log => {
    Object.keys(log).forEach(key => allKeys.add(key))
  })
  
  return Array.from(allKeys).map(key => ({
    id: key,
    header: formatHeader(key),
    accessorFn: (row) => row[key],
  }))
}
```

### Live Filtering

The filter system supports multiple filter types with live enum suggestions:

- **Service type** (postgres, auth, storage, etc.)
- **Log level** (info, warn, error)
- **Status code** for HTTP-related logs
- **Custom fields** specific to each service

### Inspection Panel

Clicking a log row opens a detailed inspection panel showing:

- Full JSON payload with syntax highlighting
- Related metadata
- Request/response details (for HTTP logs)
- Stack traces (for error logs)

## Performance Considerations

Logs can be high volume. The system uses:

- **Pagination** to avoid loading everything at once
- **Debounced filters** to prevent API spam while typing
- **POST requests** for complex queries (GET URL limits)
- **Optimistic UI updates** for responsive filtering

## Result

The unified logs system has become essential for Supabase users debugging their applications. Instead of hunting through multiple interfaces, they can see their entire system's activity in one place.
